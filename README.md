# Windows Application Recognition and Installation Script

This repository contains a bash script that scans Windows installations on connected drives, recognizes installed applications, and provides the option to install recognized applications on a Linux system using the provided "install_apps.sh" script.

## Scripts

1. **1.sh**: This script scans Windows installations on connected drives, recognizes installed applications, and generates the "recognized_apps.txt" file containing recognized application names.

2. **2.sh**: This script reads the "recognized_apps.txt" file, checks if the recognized applications are available for installation, and allows the user to install them using different package managers.

## Usage

### Step 1: Generate Recognized Applications List

1. Make sure you have the "known_apps.txt" file containing a mapping of executable names to their recognizable application names. Update this file with more mappings as needed.

2. Run the following command to make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x 1.sh
    ```

3. Run the following command to scan Windows installations and generate the list of recognized application names:

    ```bash
    ./1.sh
    ```

   This will create a file named "recognized_apps.txt" containing the recognized application names.

### Step 2: Install Recognized Applications

1. To install recognized applications based on the generated list, run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./2.sh
    ```

   - The script will prompt you for each application whether you want to install it or not.
   - You can use the `--install-all` option to automatically attempt to install all recognized applications without asking for individual confirmation.

## Notes

- The "recognized_apps.txt" file will be generated by the first script and used by the second script. Do not modify this file manually.

- Use the scripts with caution, especially the `--install-all` option, as it might install software you didn't intend to install.
